Planning a roadtrip around North America...
<!-- excerpt -->Planning a roadtrip around North America is something that I had in mind since I moved to Canada in 2010.
Canada has good policies around {% post_link Parental-leave Parental leave %}, which I am going to benefit from.
My wife and I decided we were going to spend this leave roadtripping around North America (mainly Canada probably).
The reason why we opted for a roadtrip is also because we have a dog, Darwin, who is often left home when we go travel. This time we were keen to have him onboard too.
To be completely honest, we didn't prepare much before our daughter was born, which was at the end of January. Both Niki and I are the type of people that can't really plan too much in advance. So all the preparations for this trip happened after Cassandra was born.
In February I started working on this website, which is mainly a mean of updating people where we are and what we are doing. Since I love maps, I decided I was going to keep track of our position using a normal gps phone. I wrote a quick javascript script to map the captured coordinates on google maps. You can see some tests from if you scroll back in time on the home page.
Looking for a vehicle proved to be probably the most stressful and difficult part of the preparation. We focused our search on {% post_link Roadtrek Roadtrek %}, which I quickly realized are sold very fast. We bought ours from this guy: [Basso Auto Sales](https://www.bassoautosales.com/)
At the end of May we moved our stuff to my father in law's (thanks Al) and we are now ready to take off.
The plan is to head east to Newfoundland through Quebec, New Brunswick, PEI and Nova Scotia. On the way back, we might go through the States. Then we head west.
